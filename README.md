# Inter Civitates

With the fresh memory of dying, you find yourself reborn. It seems as if you just woke up from a bad dream. You sense a feeling of nothingness. A feeling of relief. A feeling of inner peace. It reminds you of the experience of finally coming home after a long an tiresome journey.

The experience of bliss washes trough your body. You lift your head, take a deep breath and exhale. A sensation of exhaling out all the pent up burdens you've collected trough your life. You open your eyes, only to be met with the sight of a endless black void. The once feeling of bliss quickly shifts to a feeling of terror. "Where am I" you ask yourself as a desperation starts brewing.

The sound of deep waves fills the void, slowly warping into what you perceive as words. A sentence starts to take form. Trough a voice, a voice so clear it feels like its talking directly to your inner self. "Relax and welcome." You're stunned, not able to muster a word, you sit there hoping this all will end.

"You know, I was pretty startled myself when I first arrived. You might think you're dead. Well you kind of are, but not really. What you will come to think of your former self is what can be seen as being dead. But the truth is that you'll never die. You are just as alive as you've always been, and always will be".

"This is crazy" you think to your self. "The dream I just had must have warped into another bad dream. I'll surely wake up any minute now".

"No no no, again, relax" you hear the voice say. "Now give me a propper greeting, my name is Ducibus. And you are Concio".

"No I'm not! I'm Frank and where the fuck am I?!"

"Well, hello Frank. We'll get to that later. It's a little to much to wrap your head around right now. Follow me and I'll massage you into what you need to know".

It feels like all hope leaves your body. You pray to yourself that this is only a momentary thing. "I'll wake up from this dream". But as that though ends, the void transforms into somewhere you've definitely never been before. A place that seems alien, a place you can't compare to anywhere you've been before, or even been able to imagine.

## Just a game that I felt like creating.
